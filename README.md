## About the Project
Students often face problem in searching for resources best suited for their studies. Most of them are paid and the free ones' need to be searched throughout internet taking away their precious time of study.

The interface is designed to be easy to use and is the one stop place for all of our studying needs.
We have only one aim: Education must be free and available to all.
